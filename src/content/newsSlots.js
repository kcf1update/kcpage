  summary: "Carlos Sainz used Bahrain testing to experiment with a different helmet manufacturer as part of his preparation for the upcoming Formula 1 season. The Williams driver has been trialling a Stilo helmet after previously using Bell, evaluating comfort, visibility, and performance benefits before making a final decision. The change highlights how drivers continue refining even the smallest details during pre season preparation. ",
  kcsQuickShift: "People underestimate how important this is. The helmet affects visibility, balance, and driver confidence. If Sainz is testing this now, it means he is making sure absolutely everything is optimized before the season begins.",

    summary: "Ferrari engineers have revealed how their new rear wing design improves airflow efficiency while remaining fully within the 2026 regulations. The system focuses on stabilizing airflow during energy deployment phases, helping balance drag reduction with cornering performance. Rivals are already studying similar concepts as teams push the boundaries of the new aero rules.",
