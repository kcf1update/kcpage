  title: "FIA's engine compromise: A fair solution for Mercedes and its F1 rivals?",
  summary: "F1’s compression-ratio row has been settled with a compromise that tightens the rules and removes the grey area rivals feared Mercedes could exploit. From June 1, 2026, the FIA will enforce checks in both cold and hot conditions (including a hot check at 130°C), before moving to hot-only operating-condition checks from 2027.",
  kcsQuickShift: "This is the right kind of fix—close the loophole now, keep it fair both hot and cold, and stop the season starting with protests instead of racing.",
