  summary:
    "Several Formula 1 teams are questioning whether Mercedes may gain an advantage from a potential loophole in the 2026 power unit regulations, prompting discussions about possible FIA intervention. While concerns have been raised behind the scenes, any formal action would require clear evidence that the regulations are being interpreted in a way that undermines competitive fairness. At this stage, the likelihood of regulatory changes appears limited, with the FIA expected to tread carefully to avoid disrupting long-term engine development plans.",

  summary:
    "Mercedes rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli says the radical 2026 Formula 1 regulation overhaul could play into the hands of younger drivers. With cars that feel very different to previous generations, Antonelli believes less-experienced racers may adapt quicker because they’ve grown up switching machinery frequently and don’t have a fixed style tied to older cars. While he stresses that experience still matters, the reset offers a chance for newcomers to close the gap as everyone relearns the new cars.",

    "After getting behind the wheel of their 2026 Formula 1 cars at the Barcelona shakedown, drivers described the new generation as a different but exciting challenge.

Lewis Hamilton said the cars feel more agile with noticeably less downforce, and Charles Leclerc highlighted how much adaptation will matter.
