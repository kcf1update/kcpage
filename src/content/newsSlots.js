  kcsQuickShift: "This is not what Aston Martin needed at all. When the new engine partner is already dealing with battery problems before the lights even go out, you start the year chasing your tail instead of building momentum.",

    summary: "Ferrari engineers have revealed how their new rear wing design improves airflow efficiency while remaining fully within the 2026 regulations. The system focuses on stabilizing airflow during energy deployment phases, helping balance drag reduction with cornering performance. Rivals are already studying similar concepts as teams push the boundaries of the new aero rules.",
    kcsQuickShift: "This is exactly where Ferrari can surprise people. When regulations reset, creative aero solutions matter more than raw engine power. If this rear wing concept works as intended, Ferrari could gain a serious early advantage while others scramble to catch up.",
