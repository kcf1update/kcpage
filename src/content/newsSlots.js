  title: "Bernie Ecclestone hypes Gabriel Bortoleto as Audi’s potential future world champion",
  summary: "Former Formula 1 CEO Bernie Ecclestone believes Audi rookie Gabriel Bortoleto could quickly become a serious threat as the team enters its first full season. Ecclestone pointed to Audi’s strong early development progress and reliable power unit as signs the team can be competitive under the new 2026 regulations. He described Bortoleto as very fast and capable of challenging experienced team-mate Nico Hulkenberg, even suggesting he could become a future world champion.",
  kcsQuickShift: "If Audi’s car is truly competitive, Bortoleto could emerge as one of the biggest surprises of this new era.",

  title: "What is super clipping – and can it be F1’s plan B for 2026?",
  summary: "Super clipping is when a 2026 F1 car harvests energy through the MGU-K while the driver is still flat-out, typically late on straights or in fast corners—so speed drops even though the throttle stays pinned. McLaren says it successfully tested raising the harvest limit from 250kW to the full 350kW, which could reduce the need for lift-and-coast if the new cars prove too energy-starved. The catch is political and technical: changes may not suit every power-unit supplier equally, and any tweak could shift the competitive balance depending on who’s already most efficient.",
  kcsQuickShift: "This could be the FIA’s easiest ‘fix’ if 2026 racing looks too artificial, but it’s also the kind of change that instantly creates winners and losers.",

  title: "Why rain is a growing concern for teams early in the 2026 F1 season",
  summary: "Even though visibility in wet conditions might be marginally better under the 2026 cars, Formula 1 teams are increasingly worried about how the low-grip conditions will affect stability and energy harvesting during a rainy race. Very few teams have done meaningful wet running in pre-season testing, so there’s uncertainty about how the new cars will behave in wash and spray. Safety tweaks for this season’s start procedures and reduced energy harvesting on straights have been introduced with wet racing in mind, but underlying wet-weather challenges persist.",
  kcsQuickShift: "If 2026 wet races expose unpredictable stability and energy issues, teams might need specific setup and testing revisions well before the first rain-affected grands prix.",
