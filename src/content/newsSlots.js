  title: "Audi switches to Alpine-style rear wing to maximise active aero",
  summary: "Audi introduced a revised rear wing design during Bahrain testing, adopting a concept similar to Alpine that changes how the active aero flap moves under the new 2026 regulations. The updated system improves aerodynamic efficiency by reducing drag on straights and lowering energy consumption, while also helping stabilize the car during braking and transition phases. The change reflects how teams are rapidly evolving their aero concepts to maximize performance under Formula 1’s new hybrid and active aero rules.",
  kcsQuickShift: "Audi adapting this quickly shows how aggressive teams must be to stay competitive under the new aero rules.",

  title: "Gary Anderson: Test disaster is the kick Honda needed",
  summary: "Gary Anderson believes Honda’s difficult Bahrain testing with Aston Martin may ultimately force the company to react more aggressively and accelerate its power unit development. He compared the current situation to Honda’s past struggles, noting that once clear performance data exposes weaknesses, Honda typically responds quickly with upgrades and improved reliability. The severe limitations Aston Martin faced during testing may now provide the urgency needed to trigger faster progress.",

  summary: "Fernando Alonso believes Aston Martin can recover from its difficult pre-season testing despite major reliability issues, including serious Honda power unit battery failures that severely limited running in Bahrain. The team completed significantly fewer laps than rivals and enters the season opener at a disadvantage, but Alonso remains confident the problems can be fixed in both the short and medium term as development continues.",
  kcsQuickShift: "If Aston Martin solves its reliability quickly, their true performance could look very different within the first few races.",
