    "Oscar Piastri warns new 2026 F1 rules could be a ‘recipe for disaster’",
  summary:
    "Oscar Piastri has raised serious concerns about Formula 1’s new 2026 regulations, warning the reduced downforce and new driving characteristics could create safety risks, particularly at race starts. He said a full grid of cars with significantly less aerodynamic grip could lead to unpredictable and dangerous situations. The new rules emphasize energy management and different aero behavior, forcing drivers to adapt quickly to unfamiliar performance limits. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}",

  summary:
    "Formula 1 drivers are being forced to slow significantly in high-speed corners under the new 2026 regulations due to increased reliance on energy management. Fernando Alonso explained that drivers now conserve energy in fast corners to maximize deployment on straights, reducing corner speeds by as much as 50 km/h compared to previous cars. The shift reflects the new hybrid focus, where harvesting and deploying electrical energy efficiently has become more important than maintaining maximum corner speed. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}",
