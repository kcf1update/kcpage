title: "F1 chief Domenicali urges calm amid fears new 2026 rules could hurt racing",
summary: "Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has urged calm following growing driver concerns that the new 2026 regulations could negatively affect racing quality. The new power units rely heavily on electrical energy management, forcing drivers to lift off the throttle and carefully manage deployment, but Domenicali and the FIA have confirmed they are prepared to make rule changes if racing becomes less exciting.",
kcsQuickShift: "The FIA already admitting they may need to adjust the rules shows how uncertain and risky this new era really is.",

title: "Melbourne set to expose major energy management challenge for 2026 F1 cars",
summary: "The Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne is expected to be a major test for Formula 1’s new 2026 power units, as the circuit layout makes it harder for drivers to harvest electrical energy. With fewer heavy braking zones and more full-throttle sections, drivers risk running out of battery power on the straights, forcing them to lift off earlier or manage energy differently than in testing. The FIA has already discussed possible adjustments, including changes to energy deployment and harvesting limits, if racing quality is affected.",
