  title: "Christian Horner denies Verstappen influence on F1 exit, points to Helmut Marko input",
  summary: "Christian Horner has spoken publicly about his sudden departure from Red Bull in July 2025 after leading the team since its debut in Formula 1. He said the decision was made by Red Bull leadership, particularly Oliver Mintzlaff, with Helmut Marko involved in an advisory role. Horner rejected suggestions that Max Verstappen or his family influenced the decision, stating internal business changes after Dietrich Mateschitz’s death played a key role.",

  summary: "McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said race simulations during pre-season testing are the most reliable way to judge true performance, as qualifying runs often hide real pace. He noted McLaren’s race pace appeared similar to Red Bull, but warned that track temperature and testing conditions can distort comparisons. Stella believes Ferrari and Mercedes may currently hold a slight advantage heading into the season opener.",
  kcsQuickShift: "Race pace—not headline lap times—is what really reveals who can win races, and McLaren knows the real fight is still forming.",

  summary: "Ferrari introduced an innovative exhaust wing design during Bahrain testing that improves airflow efficiency and increases downforce by managing turbulent exhaust gases more effectively. The concept required specific gearbox and crash structure positioning, allowing Ferrari to maximize diffuser performance within the regulations. Because most teams designed their gearbox layout differently, rivals cannot easily replicate the solution without major structural redesigns.",
