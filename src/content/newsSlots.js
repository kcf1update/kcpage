  title: "FIA issues official statement on compression ratio dispute and proposes major rule clarification",
  summary: "The FIA confirmed it is moving to change how engine compression ratio compliance is measured after controversy surrounding the new 2026 power units. Instead of only checking the ratio at ambient temperature, the proposed change would require compliance at real operating temperatures around 130°C, closing a loophole that could allow higher compression during running conditions. The governing body has launched a vote among manufacturers, with a final decision expected soon.",
