summary: "In early 2026 testing, Audi’s Formula 1 team revealed a distinctive rear wing setup where the movable flaps pivot from a central point instead of a trailing or leading edge like most rivals. When deployed, the two flaps open at an oblique angle that could shift airflow differently over the rear of the car — a creative interpretation of the new active aero rules that sets Audi apart from competitors.",

While the car’s design and look are generating excitement, Newey acknowledged that the lost time in wind-tunnel and CFD work will likely impact the team’s early results this season.",
