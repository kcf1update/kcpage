  summary:
    "Aston Martin team principal Adrian Newey admitted the AMR26’s development was about four months behind rivals because the team didn’t get a wind-tunnel model until mid-April, compressing its research and design cycle and contributing to a last-minute Barcelona Shakedown appearance. Newey joined Aston Martin in March last year and highlighted that delays with the new AMR Technology Campus and wind tunnel pushed the squad into catch-up mode for the 2026 regulations. The slow start left the team with the fewest laps during the shakedown and a race against time to prepare properly for the upcoming season.([skysports.com](https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/33694/13502722/adrian-newey-aston-martin-team-principal-reveals-outfit-have-been-on-back-foot-by-four-months-ahead-of-2026-f1-season/10795721))",

  summary:
    "Mercedes rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli says the radical 2026 Formula 1 regulation overhaul could play into the hands of younger drivers. With cars that feel very different to previous generations, Antonelli believes less-experienced racers may adapt quicker because they’ve grown up switching machinery frequently and don’t have a fixed style tied to older cars. While he stresses that experience still matters, the reset offers a chance for newcomers to close the gap as everyone relearns the new cars.",
