title: "All the qualifying quirks F1 teams will be grappling with in 2026",
summary: "In 2026, the new cars’ heavy emphasis on energy harvesting and battery management means drivers and teams face unfamiliar challenges in qualifying, including balancing energy use with tyre prep and adapting out-lap strategy to preserve battery for the timed run. Teams may rethink prep lap routines and throttle application to maximise energy and tyre windows ahead of pushing for a fast lap. Ultimate lap time still depends on traditional speed elements, but energy strategy adds a new layer of complexity.",
kcsQuickShift: "Qualifying in 2026 isn’t just about outright pace anymore — teams will have to juggle energy harvesting, battery charge and tyre prep in ways we’ve never seen before to get a shot at pole.",

summary: "Apple TV has secured exclusive Formula 1 broadcast rights in the U.S. for the 2026 season and will stream all sessions and races live, while Netflix will carry the 2026 Canadian Grand Prix live for U.S. viewers as part of a content-sharing arrangement. The partnership also sees the eighth season of the popular Netflix docuseries ‘Drive to Survive’ available on Apple TV in the United States alongside its global Netflix release. Apple is aiming to broaden F1’s reach by combining live race coverage with expanded documentary access.",
kcsQuickShift: "This is a notable shift in how F1 is presented in the U.S.: Apple TV becomes the key broadcaster in 2026, but Netflix will stream the Canadian Grand Prix live, and Drive to Survive lands on both platforms, letting more fans dive in.",

  title: "Why rain is a growing concern for teams early in the 2026 F1 season",
  summary: "Even though visibility in wet conditions might be marginally better under the 2026 cars, Formula 1 teams are increasingly worried about how the low-grip conditions will affect stability and energy harvesting during a rainy race. Very few teams have done meaningful wet running in pre-season testing, so there’s uncertainty about how the new cars will behave in wash and spray. Safety tweaks for this season’s start procedures and reduced energy harvesting on straights have been introduced with wet racing in mind, but underlying wet-weather challenges persist.",
  kcsQuickShift: "If 2026 wet races expose unpredictable stability and energy issues, teams might need specific setup and testing revisions well before the first rain-affected grands prix.",
